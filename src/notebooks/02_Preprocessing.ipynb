    "# Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "In this notebook, we will **prepare the dataset** for model training by applying necessary preprocessing steps. Since credit card fraud detection involves **imbalanced data**, proper preprocessing is essential for building an effective model.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Steps to Cover\n",
    "1. **Feature Scaling** – Standardizing numerical features to improve model performance.  \n",
    "2. **Handling Class Imbalance** – Applying **SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique)** to balance fraud and non-fraud cases.  \n",
    "3. **Feature Selection** – Removing redundant or highly correlated features if necessary.  \n",
    "4. **Final Dataset Check** – Ensuring data is properly preprocessed before moving to model training.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why is Preprocessing Important?\n",
    "- **Fraudulent transactions are rare**, meaning an unbalanced dataset can lead to biased models.\n",
    "- Some machine learning models (e.g., logistic regression, neural networks) **perform better with scaled features**.\n",
    "- Oversampling techniques like **SMOTE** help models learn fraud patterns more effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Next Step: Feature Scaling\n",
    "Before applying **SMOTE**, we will first scale our features to ensure they are in the same range.  "
